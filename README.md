<h2> Intro to Shell </h2>

-  What Is the Shell?

The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry
out. Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called
bash.

The name "bash" is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact
bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
Steve Bourne.

- Terminal Emulators

When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need another program called a "terminal
emulator" to interact with the shell.

KDE uses konsole and GNOME uses gnome-terminal, though it's
likely called simply “terminal” on our menu.

- Launching Terminal

If you are using ubuntu just type "ctrl + alt + t " it will open the new terminal.
