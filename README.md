<h2> Intro to Shell <h2>

1. What Is the Shell?

- The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry
out. Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called
bash.

- The name "bash" is an acronym for “Bourne Again SHell”, a reference to the fact
bash is an enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
Steve Bourne.

2. Terminal Emulators
- When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need another program called a "terminal
emulator" to interact with the shell.

- KDE uses konsole and GNOME uses gnome-terminal, though it's
likely called simply “terminal” on our menu.

3. Launching Terminal
- If you are using ubuntu just type "ctrl + alt + t " it will open the new terminal.

4. So Basically What is $ ?
-  $ is a shell prompt and it will appear on the terminal
