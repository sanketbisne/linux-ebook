<h2> More about file types </h2>

Linux treat the file extension as "everything is a file"

For example if a file extension is jpeg or mp3 and if we want to know the file type then simply we can type " file filename "

lets download an image from web by 

`wget "https://cdn.quotesgram.com/img/64/68/871911642-Peace-Facebook-Covers-2063.jpeg"`

`ls`

`file 871911642-Peace-Facebook-Covers-2063.jpeg`

In output it will show the file is of type jpeg.
