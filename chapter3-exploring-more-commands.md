<h2> Exploring more Commands with their flags </h2>

1.  ls

As we saw earlier ls command is used to list down files/Folder in Directories
if we want some hidden files ie which start with . in linux
to be displayed on the terminal we can use 

- ls -a  ->  It list all files and also which starts from . (hidden files).

- ls -al ->  It displays results in long format.
- ls -d  -> It will list the contents of the directory.
- ls -F  -> It appends an indicator charactor to the end of each listed name. / if the name is directory.
- ls -r  -> Displays results in reverse order
- ls -t  -> Sorts by modification time
- ls -s  -> sorts output by file size
- ls -ltrh -> print the output in long listed , sorted by modification time  and human readable format.
